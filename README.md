# Twitter-Sentiment-analysis
we are going to set a system to evaluate in real time the sentiment of all Tweets made with a specific Twitter hashtag.
We are going to use a basic Python script to obtain real time Tweets thanks to the Twitter API, from the script we’ll put the Tweets directly in a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream where we have a transformation Lambda function, in that moment we are going to obtain the sentiment information using Amazon Comprehend and obtain a clean Twitter comment, finally the Tweet and its sentiment data will be stored in an Elasticsearch domain where we can see real time information using custom charts.
Twitter API First we’ll need credentials to access the Twitter API so if you don’t have them this is where you can start: https://apps.twitter.com/ Or we can download sample datasets of tweets.
